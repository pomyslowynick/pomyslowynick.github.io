Hello! I am a young (at the time of writing) software engineer, recently graduated with Hons. BSc. in [Software Development from Munster Technological University](https://cs.cit.ie/sdh).  
My interests lie in distributed systems, programming languages and static analysis.  
This website serves primarily as a place to [blog about papers and work](/blog) I do in my own time. All of the opinions expressed on this page are solely mine.
