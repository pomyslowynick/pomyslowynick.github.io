## Week 1
Term scientist has been coined by William Whewell in XIX century. Before that people who studied nature were called "natural philosophers".

The course will examine four great scientific theories/discoveries:
* Theory of evolution
Darwin and relation from a UPenn lab working on flies and changing their genome using CRISPR to observe evolutional adaptations.
* Aging of the universe
The introduction mentions that Hubble has observed a redshift through his telescope, which proves that the unvierse is expanding.
Redshift is akin to doppler effect, just like sound waves of a passing ambulance change their frequency as it moves away,
so does the light. In effect the galaxies which are getting further away from us emit light at a different frequency, shifting more to red.

Typical candle gives about 12 lumens of light next to it.
*Inverse square law* - intesity of light decreases as in the inverse square law with the distance.
Same candle if we move five meters away will be only emitting 1/2 lumen to us.
*Cepheid variable* - a type of start that pulsates radially with a well-defined, stable period and amplitude.
Those can be used to measure the distances from othe galaxies. 
* Climate Change
Brief history of climate change research.
* Theory of mind
Making complex inferences about our environment and other people is an incredible capacity which allows society to function.
I've never thought about it, but the fact that people can infer in advance what behaviour will result in facilitates human interactions.
It's pretty obvious, but acknowledging that this underlying mechanism exists seems like a powerful realization.
False belief task is used to examine this behaviour.

## Week 2
> Liking the course a lot so far.

Double blind randomized trials are the golden standard. Those trials should then be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Scientific empiricisim - idea that all our knowledge should come from unbiased observations about the world.
Scientific knowledge has to be grounded in evidence, belief which was established during the scientific revolution which took place in XVI and XVII centuries.

Sources of scientific knowledge:
* Observation
    Looking for patterns or distributions can be basis for deriving facts from the observed environment.
* Experimentation
* Simulation
