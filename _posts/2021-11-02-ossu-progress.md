Tracking my progress in the various courses I have finished, most of them should be ones included in the [OSSU CS Curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). 
I have started N2Tetris on 15th of October 2021. As the time went by I have taken on more and more courses and put in more hours per week, but I will count this date as the start of my journey.
If I am to follow more or less the college curriculum then I should have 6, ~12 week courses finished by 15th of January.

- [Nand to Tetris Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

Finished on 1st of November 2021, quite proud I've finally done it.

- [Nand to Tetris Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2) 

In progress (as of 2nd of November), seems much more demanding the the previous part.
Still in week 1 as of 11 Nov 2021, gotta work on it a bit more.

- [Programming Langauges A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)
- Programming Langauges B
- Programming Langauges C

In progress, trying to take on a few courses in one "semester", just like I did in college. So I am aiming for more or less 6 courses in 3-4 months.

I would actually count whole PLABC as one course, so I have to restart this one. I have already finished it three years ago, but it's so good I don't mind redoing it.

- [Cloud Computing (Specialization)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cloud-computing)

Second specialization which I want to pursue as part of OSSU, it is well aligned with my current job and I enjoy learning about the cloud and distributed systems.

Already started the first part [Cloud Computing Concepts, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing), it seems it's actually a course in distributed systems. That should involve some repetition of stuff I have already studied for my FYP.

- [Introduction to Mathematical Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking) 

I am taking it to warm myself up for the more rigorous math courses in the curriculum. It has always been very difficult for me and I want to work on it but taking it at a slower pace.

[Feel good article](https://qz.com/139453/theres-one-key-difference-between-kids-who-excel-at-math-and-those-who-dont/) making a point that mathematics can be learnt and people aren't inherintly bad or good at it... at least to a certain degree.

- [Fullstack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

It's about the time I really worked on my WebDev skills. I have already picked up some in my work, but it was more ad hoc and not really thorough.

Outside the curriculum:
- [Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob - Physically Based Rendering, Third Edition - From Theory to Implementation](https://pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents)
    
Really want to read this book, it's said to be well written and takes on a unique perspective of Computer Graphics that I don't know all that much about. Additionaly it should give me some good exposure to C++.

- [Bob Nystrom, Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html)

I was always fascinated by Compilers and this book would be a great introduction to them. It would let me get better understanding of what happens underneath the hood when I compile my code.

- [Advanced Programming Techniques in C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJE7waQvuTs&list=PLbHYdvrWBMxazo1_B6vhW9gpd1wlkdeEW&index=1)

- [Implementing TCP in Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzja9fQWzdA&list=PLqbS7AVVErFivDY3iKAQk3_VAm8SXwt1X)
