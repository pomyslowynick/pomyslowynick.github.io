Tracking my progress in the various courses I have finished, most of them should be ones included in the [OSSU CS Curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)

- [Nand to Tetris Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

Finished on 1st of November 2021, quite proud I've finally done it.

- [Nand to Tetris Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2) 

In progress (as of 2nd of November), seems much more demanding the the previous part.

Next
- Computer Networking - A Top-Down Approach
- OSTEP Book [Videos](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Spring2018/Discussion/videos.html), [Schedule](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Spring2018/), [Book](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
- Programming Langauges A
- Programming Langauges B
- Programming Langauges C
- [Missing Semester](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z56Jmr9Z34Q&list=PLyzOVJj3bHQuloKGG59rS43e29ro7I57J)

- [Fullstack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

It's about the time I really worked on my WebDev skills. I have already picked up some in my work, but it was more ad hoc and not really thorough.

- [Cloud Computing (Specialization)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cloud-computing)

Second specialization which I want pursue as part of OSSU, it is well aligned with my current job and I enjoy learning about the cloud and distributed systems.

Outside the curriculum:
- [Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob - Physically Based Rendering, Third Edition - From Theory to Implementation](https://pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents)
    
Really want to read this book, it's said to be well written and takes on a unique perspective of Computer Graphics that I don't know all that much about. Additionaly it should give me some good exposure to C++.

- [Bob Nystrom, Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html)

I was always fascinated by Compilers and this book would be a great introduction to them. It would let me get better understanding of what happens underneath the hood when I compile my code.

- [Advanced Programming Techniques in C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJE7waQvuTs&list=PLbHYdvrWBMxazo1_B6vhW9gpd1wlkdeEW&index=1)
