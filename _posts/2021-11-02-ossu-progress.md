Tracking my progress in the various courses I have finished, most of them should be ones included in the [OSSU CS Curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). 
I have started N2Tetris on 15th of October 2021. ( I have originally planned to do OSSU in 2018, which is the last time I really have been doing the courses in the curriculum) As the time went by I have taken on more and more courses and put in more hours per week, but I will count this date as the start of my journey.
If I am to follow more or less the college curriculum then I should have 6, ~12 week courses finished by 1st of February, given that January is gonna be really busy I might need bit more time. The books I've choosen have a lot in them and I want to take my time and process as much as I can.

The Spring semester will start on 1st of March, month of February wil serve as break or eventual closing of the last few courses.

> Worth considering that math courses will take ages to finish in this scenario, should probably do some next "academic year" or during the Summer.

### Week 0 - 8th to 14th November

I have about ~11 weeks until 1st of February to finish the first semester.

My first week of officially following this schedule will begin on 15th of Novemeber, but the truth is I have done some of the course material already and have a big headstart. At the same time I am working full time so following the academic life 1 to 1 is almost impossible. 

### Week 1 - 15th to 21th November
In this week I would like to have the first week of each module finished.

Monday -I did go over several videos of PLA, haven't finished the assignment or the week. I am in week 4 at the moment, so ahead of the schedule.

Tuesday - Finished the lectures for the first week and first assignment for math, still have assignment 2 and problem set left to do.

Wednesday - Not officialy a study day, but got some time to spend on PLA and math assignment. Gotta work on my French too, as it is important to retain the information.

Thursday - Started chapter 1 of Computer Networking, it's very approachable and I can already see some terms I have seen but didn't fully understand come up. Finished on page 53.

Friday - Didn't spend any time on N2T, tried to finish the homework for PLA and focused on the French lesson.

Saturday - Finished last few exercises in homework for PLA week 4, it takes way more time than the suggested amount, and I have already solved them before. 

Sunday - day off.

### Week 2 - 22th - 28th Nov
Monday - Finished PLA, again. Feeling like I understood way more this time around, I definitely remember that I felt lost watching chapter 5 videos in 2018. Good to see there has been some progress :D

Tuesday - Continued on with Math Thinking module, still haven't finished problem set I.
Lecturer has specified that we are not meant to actually solve all the problems, but I want to give it a bit more time.

Thursday - got hang up on PLB course, I just like it so much I couldn't resist spending the evening solving homework exercises.
Finished week 6.

## Week 3 - 29th - 5th Dec
Monday - Slow start, but got some good work done on PLB, small bit on Mathematical Thinking too.

Tuesday - Finished PLB, man it really was a mindbending exercise to implement the closures! So proud of myself, finally stayed disciplined enough to make it through the whole thing. Started PLC, couldn't keep myself from breaking the schedule. I haven't really kept up with it so far.

Thursday - Finished HW6 in week 1 of PLC, was kinda easy actually. I think it's because of my previous experience with OOP, didn't take more than a couple of hours.
Should probably stick to the schedule more starting next week. Hope to finish PLC this week. 
As I am in week 3 already and several of the other courses have been stuck on week 1 I think I need to revise my strategy a bit. Specific dedicated study hours could be useful here. Tomorrow I will be working with N2T.

- [Nand to Tetris Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

Finished on 1st of November 2021, quite proud I've finally done it.

- [Nand to Tetris Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2) 

In progress (as of 2nd of November), seems much more demanding the the previous part.
Still in week 1 as of 11 Nov 2021, gotta work on it a bit more.

- [Programming Langauges A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)
- [Programming Langauges B](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-b)
- [Programming Langauges C](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-c)

In progress, trying to take on a few courses in one "semester", just like I did in college. So I am aiming for more or less 6 courses in 3-4 months.
I would actually count whole PLABC as one course, so I have to restart this one. I have already finished it three years ago, but it's so good I don't mind redoing it.

- [Cloud Computing (Specialization)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cloud-computing)

Second specialization which I want to pursue as part of OSSU, it is well aligned with my current job and I enjoy learning about the cloud and distributed systems.

Already started the first part [Cloud Computing Concepts, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing), it seems it's actually a course in distributed systems. That should involve some repetition of stuff I have already studied for my FYP.

- [Introduction to Mathematical Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking) 

I am taking it to warm myself up for the more rigorous math courses in the curriculum. Math has always been very difficult for me and I want to work on it but to take it at a slower pace in the same time.

[Feel good article](https://qz.com/139453/theres-one-key-difference-between-kids-who-excel-at-math-and-those-who-dont/) making a point that mathematics can be learnt and people aren't inherintly bad or good at it... at least to a certain degree.

- Computer Networking - A Top-Down Approach

Very needed introduction to networking, it would help a ton in my current role as well as benefit my overall understanding of CS. It's probably just a first book in the series of ones I should read for my current role.

- OSTEP Book [Videos - 2018](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Spring2018/Discussion/videos.html), [Videos - 2021](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Fall2021/Discussion/videos.html), [Schedule](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Spring2018/), [Book](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)

14 Lectures, loads of material. Finish that in ~12 weeks might be impossible, but it's worth to try and maybe come back to some of the material later.

- [Fullstack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

It's about the time I really worked on my WebDev skills. I have already picked up some in my work, but it was more ad hoc and not really thorough.

Outside the curriculum:
- [Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob - Physically Based Rendering, Third Edition - From Theory to Implementation](https://pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents)
    
Really want to read this book, it's said to be well written and takes on a unique perspective of Computer Graphics that I don't know all that much about. Additionaly it should give me some good exposure to C++.

- [Bob Nystrom, Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html)

I was always fascinated by Compilers and this book would be a great introduction to them. It would let me get better understanding of what happens underneath the hood when I compile my code.
