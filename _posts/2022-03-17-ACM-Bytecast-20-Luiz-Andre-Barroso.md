Expertise in hardware and software alike, emigrated from Brasil.

Wanted to become an engineer since age of 8.

Queueing theory was what got Luiz hooked in the field of computing.
The equations there were based on principles which computers could not adhere to, but they helped design systems which helped predict and solve those problems.

Coherence and consistency of memory systems were crucial for multiple processor systems.

Scarcity brings clarity, Barroso had to create WSCs using desktop class components in the beginning. That's where they have created software solutions to make it work, like GFS, distributed switching fabric out of cheaper switches.

#### Innovation
2-3% performance improvements are reasons to brag about, obssesive focus on improving the efficiency at hardware and software level, to the point where it might be overcorrected.
The problem today might be that we don't overoptimize where the complexity raises significantly.

Two classes of companies: ones that weren't born in "digital era", banks, grocery stores. They are less likely to have computing requirements at scale of Google.
But digital first companies like Twitter have rather signifcant needs for computing capacity.
Over time there will be more and more companies that will need this kind of computing.

The way to extend "Moores Law" is to improve the software, according to the interviewer.
Another area which can bring significant improvement is the hardware accelerators, like TPUs Google has been able to achieve 30-40x improvements.

Specialized hardware seems to be general way to go. General purpose computing is not as important any more if there's large enough market for given use case.

Drive by areas of "ignorance", every 4-5 years Luiz is changing his area of expertise.

There are different ways to succeed in CS, could get invested in one field or change it every now and then.

Being excited can be enough of motivation to go through the difficult period of not knowing anything. It happens every once in a while that a fresh pair of eyes can spot reasoning patterns that others don't see anymore.

Decisions made early in the career are not that consequential in the long run.
