What is cloud computing?

* On-demand self-service
* Broad network access
* Resource pooling
* Rapid elsaticity
* Measured service

As per the Google course, those are the characteristics of cloud computing.
I don't think it's a very formal definition, but it says a lot about the business characteristics of cloud besides the concept itself.

GCP regions are similar to AWS regions I am familiar with.
They have a notion of multi-region which stores data in multiple geographically separated regions.

GCP can be split into:
* Compute services
* Storage services
* Big Data services
* Machine learning services

Google uses hardware security chip called "Titan", wonder how does it work.

GCP has four tools to limit the GCP bills:
* Budgets
* Alerts
* Billing exports
* Reports
* Quotas to prevent over consumption of resources
    * Rate Quotas - reset after specific time. 
    Example 1,000 requests per 100 seconds.
    * Allocation quotas - restriction on number of resources you can utilize. For example: each GCP project has default quota of 5 VPC.

IAM - Google Cloud Identity and Acces Management.

Projects are the main way to group related resources.

Folders -> Projects -> Resources 

IAM policies are inherited downwards in the hierarchy, resources can have individual policies too.

Each GCP project has a name and a project number

IAM policy
Who - can do what - on which resource

Who - what user, google group, service account, google account.
Can do what - defined by IAM role which is a collection of permissions

There are three types of IAM roles
* Primitive
* Predefined
* Custom
