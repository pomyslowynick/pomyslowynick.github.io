Modern mathemathics is about analyzing patterns, for example logic studies patterns of reasoning and probability theory studies the patterns of how often events happen in real life, randomness.

Banach-Tarski Paradox - a sphere could be cut in such a way that it could be assembled into two spheres of the same size as the original one.

Misuses of language can become it's constructs. The human language is inherently imprecise. Shared common understanding of reality allows us to infer the meaning, even if the sentence isn't precise.

Proof is the basis of establshing the truth in mathemathics.

Almost all of langauge constructs in maths are of four types:
* Object a has property P.
* Every object of type T has property P.
* There is an object of type T having property P.
* If statement A, then statement B.

Gauss theorem:
> If p is a prime of the form 4n+1, then p is a sum of two squares.

math keywords:
* and
* or
* not
* implies
* for all
* there exists

Formal logic is a branch of math which uses the above keywords.

Assignment 1:

1.  Man holding a telescope saw the woman
    Man saw the woman holding a telescope
2.  a. After ten years sisters have reunited in checkout line at Safeway.
    b. A large hole appears in High Street, city authorities are looking into the issue.
    c. Mayor says bus passengers should wear seatbelts.
3.  - No head injury is too trivial to ignore.
    - All head injuries should be be consulted.
4.  Contextually right meaning, if there is fire do not use the elevator. Second meaning "don't use the elevator to put out the fire"? 
> First meaning : The elevator is to be used only in case there is a fire. (Actually this has an even stronger meaning if you replace the comma with a period.)
I don't really get it to be honest.
Reformulation: If the building is burning exit through the stairs.
5.  "This page intentionally left blank" - the obvious meaning is that a page has been left blank on purpose when printing a book, not accidentally. It could also mean that this page has literally left a blank? The sidenote seems to allude to GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem, if I am right. Then this quote should be a rehashing of liars paradox. 
6.  - Panda eats shoots and leaves. (I guess?)
    - This man is on his phone.
    - Don't call me in the evening.
7.   "The temperature is hot today." - the temperature isn't literally hot, it's high as it is a numerical measure. If the temperature itself was hot then it wouldn't have anything to do with the actual weather.
8.  (2*3*5*7*11*13)+1 = 30031

Lecture 2 goes over logical operators/combinators. I am quite familiar with them from the N2T course and discrete maths module in college.
