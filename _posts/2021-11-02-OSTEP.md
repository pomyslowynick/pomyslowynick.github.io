First day of OSTEP, reading through Intro and the first few chapters on processes.

The CPU cycle - fetch instructions, decode them, execute them.

Virtualization is the first abstraction explored:
* Processes have this illusion that they have their own private memory, called virtual memory.
* CPUs are virtualized too, processes are under the impression that CPU belongs only to them.

We will learn about file systems and concurrency (yay).

Lecture 1-1 is kinda useful as an overview of what will learn about.
1-2 is mostly about the course itself for the Uni of Wisconsin students, it's safe to skip in my opinion.
