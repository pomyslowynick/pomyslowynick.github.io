### Week 1
This blog post consists of my notes about the C++ course.


C++ is a strongly typed programming language.

{% highlight c++ %}
int myint = 3;

{% endhighlight %}

There are two types of variables:
* Primitive
* User Defined

The primitives are:
* `int`
* `float`
* `double`
* `char`
* `void`
* `bool`

#### 1.2
Notion of encapsulation is introduced, class is presented as an entity which encloses data and functionality within itself.
Seems like C++ is object-oriented language.

Encapsulation extends to public and private elements within the class. `private` and `public` classifiers are used for that in C++.
Private functions and data can be accessed only by the class itself, public can be accessed by "client" code.

`.h` header files provide the *inteface* to the class, separate from the implementation in `.cpp`.

Header file includes declaration of all *member variables* and *member functions*. It's akin to API.

{% highlight c++%}
// Always present in .h files
// Instructs the compiler to only compile this file once
#pragma once

class Cube {
    public:
        double getVolume();
        double getSurfaceArea();
        void setLength(double length);

    private:
        double length_;
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c++%}
void Cube::setLength(double length) {
    length_ = length;
}
{% endhighlight %}

### 1.3

`std` is C++ standard library, organized into many separate sub-libraries.
`iostream` allows to output data to files or console.
`using` is a keyword which allows us to call methods without indicating the class (I guess). 
It shouldn't be used too much as it reduces codereadability.

### 2.1
Lifecycle of a function is associated with it's stack (simple). Stack grows from high to low addresses (is that a general rule?).
> The concept of the stack growing downward is often true on many computer architectures (but not universally).
Kinda expected.

NEVER return a reference to a local variable, otherwise, guess what, you have a dangling pointer.

"Heap memory is independent of the lifecycle of a function" - never thought about that way, it's nicely phrased.
Creating new heap memory in C++ is done with `new` operator. It returns a pointer to the memory storing the data, not an isntance of the data itself. The only time memory is ever reclaimed is when pointer is passed to `delete` operator.`
`nullptr` - pointer holding address 0x0, effectively a null address. Leads to a segfault when someone tries to access it.
Invoking `delete` on a pointer holding address of a heap object only releases this object. The pointer still holds the value of the memory address it referenced.

{% highlight c++%}
int i = 2, j = 4, k = 8;
int *p = &i, *q = &j, *r = &k;

k = i;
cout << i << j << k << *p << *q << *r << endl; // 2 4 2 2 4 2

p = q;
cout << i << j << k << *p << *q << *r << endl; // 2 4 2 4 4 2

*q = *r;
cout << i << j << k << *p << *q << *r << endl; // 2 2 2 2 2 2
