Back to blogging as suggested by the book [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/), I want to understand better how ML works, it's so prevalent that I feel like I am missing out by not knowing anything about it.

There's many books that I would like to read about the topic and projects associated with it. Ultimately I want to have good conceptual understanding of the whole ML lifecycle and develop some practical skills in MLOps area.
I would love to work at the intersection of distributed systems, networking and ML, as I feel that it's developing area with plenty of opportunities.

I have found dozens of well reviewed books in the area, but there are three which I find the most relevant to what I am working on at the moment:
- [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/) - recommender systems, and many other, rely on deep learning to create the models. Understanding how it works will give me the needed foundation in this aspect of ML.
- [Fundamentals of Data Engineering](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-data/9781098108298/) - how is the data stored, transformed and exposed in modern tech stacks. I think it's essential to understand it to know how the ML part works.
- [Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-machine-learning/9781098107956) - extremely well received book on ML systems, which is exactly what I want to learn more about.
It's the closest to an MLOps book I've found, it seems to be more on the theory side.

For more practical aspects where I actually do build some stuff I have the following resources:
- [Machine Learning Engineering for Production (MLOps) Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops) - another very well rated resource, it has some practical labs and will most probably be a good book companion (and vice versa). Specialization costs 45 euro per month.
- [Datacamp ML Engineer Track](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/machine-learning-engineer) - a mix of courses and projects.
- [MLOps Zoomcamp](https://github.com/pomyslowynick/mlops-zoomcamp) - I've forked this one, it's just few modules, so seems short. I might be able to join the next cohort?

There's dozens more of resources, but even completing the above should take a long time and will make me much more capable.
